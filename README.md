Iâ€™m a clean coder and team lead who focus on develop high quality code following the best practices, always looking for a challenge and an opportunity to learn more.

My main languages are Kotlin and Java, with a focus on implementing distributed systems with an event driven microservice architecture that can scale and growth over time.
